As a user
I want a string add function
So that I can see what 2 concatenated strings look like

When I enter a string
And I choose the add function
And I enter a second string
Then I should see the second string concatenated to the end of the first string.

When I enter a string
And I choose the add function
And I hit enter without typing a second string
Then I should see just the first string.


As a user
I want a string remove function
So that I can see what a string can look like without its last n characters

Given I enter a string of greater than 3 characters
When I enter the string
And I choose the remove characters function
And I specify I want 3 characters removed
Then I should see the string with the last 3 characters removed

Given I enter a string of exactly 3 characters
When I entere the string
And I choose the remove characters function
And I specify I want 3 characters removed
Then I should see no characters


As a user
I want the string remove function to error out when I attempt to remove more characters than there are in the string
So that I know I cannot remove that many characters from the world

Given I enter a string of length 3
When I enter the string
And I choose the remove character function
And I specify I want 3 characters removed
Then I should see an error alerting me I can't remove that many characters
